# week 3 homework

Question 6, my result is 100 however from the hint I undrestood the right answer is the smallest c of multple records so I changed it to 0.1

 ```python

[[0.01, np.float64(0.66)],
 [0.1, np.float64(0.791)],
 [1, np.float64(0.791)],
 [10, np.float64(0.791)],
 [100, np.float64(0.796)]]
