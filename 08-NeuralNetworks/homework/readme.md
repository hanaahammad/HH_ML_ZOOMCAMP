# Hair Type Classification with a Convolutional Neural Network (PyTorch)

This project builds and trains a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** from scratch to classify images of hair into two categories:

- **Curly**
- **Straight**

The workflow follows the structure of a machine learning homework project:  
1) baseline model training,  
2) analysis of results,  
3) continued training with data augmentation.

The implementation uses **PyTorch**, **torchvision**, and GPU acceleration when available.
